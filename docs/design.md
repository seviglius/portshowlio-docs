# Design
* Using Sketch, Adobe XD or other desired UI design software
* Focus on working collaboratively on the file and producing a rock solid and organized file with everything named
* While designing, keep in mind that by week 4 you will need to inform your peers what size/ratio of images they will need to be formatting for their individual pages, even if aesthetic design is not completed.
* Once your desktop and mobile designs are complete, they should be uploaded to invision or other prototyping tool of your choice to preview.
